# Style Report
For the website I have decided to choose Visual Style 1. It is simple and clean layout which will be easy for the user to navigate through. The content necessary for browsing will be available at all times. This layout is not cluttered at all and this will keep the user's interest in the content being browsed.  
Also, in terms of coding, and a website that will always be changing depending on the content updates, it is a more flexible layout that can be styled.
