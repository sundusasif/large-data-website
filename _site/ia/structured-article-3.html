<h2>Deep Sea Research</h2>

<p>Humans have explored less than 2% of the ocean floor, and dozens of new species of deep sea creatures are discovered with every dive. The submariens that explore these dark depths can withstand extreme pressure and is easily manoeuvrable despite the weight and size.
However, studying deep sea creatures is problematic; since, with the extreme change in pressure, and the environment in general, these creatures can&#39;t survive for very long, if at all, on the surface. This makes in depth research difficult because so much of what we want to know about only occurs while the creatures are alive. Recent developments have allowed scientists to look at these creatures more closely, and for a longer time. A marine biologist, Jeffery Drazen, has explored a solution, a pressurized fish trap. This captures a deep-water creature, and adjusts its internal pressure slowly to surface level as the creature is brought to the surface, in the hope that the creature can adjust.
Another scientific team, from the Universite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universite_Pierre_et_Marie_Curie">Pierre et Marie Curie</a>, has developed a capture device known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PERISCOP">PERISCOP</a>, which maintains water pressure as it surfaces, thus keeping the samples in a pressurized environment during the ascent. This permits close study on the surface without any pressure disturbances effecting the sample.</p>

<h2>Exploration</h2>

<p>Deep-sea exploration is the investigation of physical, chemical, and biological conditions on the sea bed, for scientific or commercial purposes. Deep-sea exploration is considered as a relatively recent human activity compared to the other areas of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysical">geophysical</a> research, as the depths of the sea have been investigated only during comparatively recent years. The ocean depths still remain as a largely unexplored part of the planet, and form a relatively undiscovered domain.
The first instrument used for deep-sea investigation was the sounding weight, used by British explorer Sir James Clark Ross. With this instrument, he reached a depth of 3,700 m (12,140 ft) in 1840. The Challenger expedition used similar instruments called Baillie sounding machines to extract samples from the sea bed.
In 1960, Jacques Piccard and US Navy Lieutenant Donald Walsh descended in the bathyscaphe Trieste into the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the world&#39;s oceans, to make the deepest dive in history: 10,915 meters (35,810 ft).On 25 March 2012, filmmaker James Cameron descended into the deepest part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_Trench">Mariana Trench</a> and, for the first time, is expected to have filmed and sampled the bottom.</p>

<h3>Milestones in deep sea exploration</h3>

<p>The extreme conditions in the deep sea require elaborate methods and technologies, which has been the main reason why its exploration has a comparatively short history. In the following, important key stones of deep sea exploration are listed.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>1521</strong>: Ferdinand Magellan tried to measure the depth of the Pacific ocean with a 2400 ft weighted line, but did not find bottom.</li>
<li><strong>1818</strong>: The British researcher Sir John Ross was the first to find that the deep sea is inhabited by life when catching jellyfish and worms in about 2000 m (6550 ft) depth with a special device.</li>
<li><strong>1843</strong>: Nevertheless, Edward Forbes claimed that diversity of life in the deep sea is little and decreases with increasing depth. He stated that there could be no life in waters deeper than 550 m (1800 ft), the so-called Abyssus Theory.</li>
<li><strong>1850</strong>: Near the Lofoten, Michael Sars found a rich deep sea fauna in a depth of 800 m (2600 ft) thereby refuting the Abyssus Theory.</li>
<li><strong>1872–1876</strong>: The first systematic deep sea exploration was conducted by the Challenger Expedition on board the ship HMS Challenger led by Charles Wyville Thomson. This expedition revealed that the deep sea harbours a diverse, specialized biota.</li>
<li><strong>1890–1898</strong>: First Austrian-Hungarian deep sea expedition on board the ship SMS Pola led by Franz Steindachner in the eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea.</li>
<li><strong>1898–1899</strong>: First German deep sea expedition on board the ship Valdivia led by Carl Chun; found many new species from depths greater than 4000 m (13000 ft) in the southern Atlantic Ocean.</li>
<li><strong>1930</strong>: William Beebe and Otis Barton are the first humans to reach the Deep Sea when diving in the so-called <em>Bathysphere</em>, made from steel. They reach a depth of 435 m (1430 ft), where they observed jellyfish and shrimp.</li>
<li><strong>1934</strong>: The <em>Bathysphere</em> reached a depth of 923 m (3028 ft).</li>
<li><strong>1948</strong>: Otis Barton set out for a new record reaching a depth of 1370 m (4495 ft).</li>
<li><strong>1960</strong>: Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh reached the bottom of the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, descending to a depth of 10,740 m (35236 ft) in their deep sea vessel Trieste, where they observed fish and other deep sea organisms.</li>
<li><strong>2012</strong>: The vessel <em>Deepsea Challenger</em>, piloted by James Cameron, completes the second manned voyage and first solo mission to the bottom of the Challenger Deep.</li>
