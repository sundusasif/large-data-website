<h1>Characteristics of Deep Sea Fish</h1>

<p>-by Samantha Herman</p>

<p><em>&quot;Fish that live in the extreme environment deep in the bottom of the sea are much different from the animals that live in shallow water. They have a few distinct characteristics that have allowed them to flourish in a seemingly inhospitable region.&quot;</em></p>

<h2>Large Eyes</h2>

<p>In the very deep parts of the ocean, very little light filters through to the bottom. The fish that live and hunt in this space have developed very large eyes to take in the minute amounts of light.</p>

<h2>Bioluminescence</h2>

<p>Many deep sea fish have developed a means of creating their own light through bioluminescence. This is a chemical reaction that occurs inside of the fish, causing portions of the body to glow.</p>

<h2>Withstanding Pressure</h2>

<p>In the far depths of the sea, the pressure on an organism can be incredible. The bones of a deep sea fish are softer than normal, allowing them to withstand the extreme amounts of pressure.</p>

<h2>Expanding Stomach</h2>

<p>Like many creatures that do not eat on a regular basis, fish at the bottom of the ocean have learned to gorge themselves whenever they find food because there might not be any tomorrow. Their stomachs expand to accommodate a large amount of food in one sitting.</p>

<h2>Colorings</h2>

<p>Extravagant colorings are not needed in the deep sea environment. These fish are transparent, black or silvery to not draw attention to themselves. If they need to attract attention, they use bioluminescence.</p>
