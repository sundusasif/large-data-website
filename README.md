# Deep Sea Creatures

---
Over 60% of earth is covered by water. Deep Seas take up a large portion of our landscape and it is amazing that even uptil now, it is largely unexplored. 

The environmental conditions in deep sea are completely different than what they are up on land. These differences result in some pretty amazing creatures that are now being discovered. Until recently, people thought that life is not possible in these tremendous depths, but the truth is that in the dark depths of the sea, strange lifeforms florish like no where on earth. These lifeforms are different from anything ever seen and unique in every sense. 

Deep sea characteristics is an exciting subject and I have always wanted to learn more about the evolution of the creatures that live there.


## Purpose

This is a school project to learn about making design systems for large-scale websites.


Not only will I learn about Github but will be able to increase my knowledge about the deep sea Abyss.
