         <blockquote><p>The angler gets its name from the elongated dorsal spine that supports a light-producing organ known as a photophore. This photophore can produce a blue-green light similar to that of a firefly on land.</p></blockquote>

          <h2>Weird world</h2>

<p>The bizarre inhabitants of the deep include: deep water sharks; devilish-looking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfish">dragonfish</a>, that fire beams of red illumination from "lamps" under their eyes; many bioluminescent fish; ancient coelacanths; creeping sea lilies; blood-red squid; an octopus with glow-in-the-dark suckers; bell-shaped, metre-wide jellyfish, snails with armour-plated feet and a deadly jellyfish relative that uses fluorescent tentacles to lure prey.

Perhaps the most dramatic creature is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_squid">13-metre-long giant squid</a>, Architeuthis and the even more fearsome 15-metre-long colossal squid, never seen alive. <a href="http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/sperm-whale/">Sperm whales</a> and <a href="http://marinebio.org/species.asp?id=382">Antarctic sleeper sharks</a> are the only animals equipped to take on these deep-sea prey.

Life is also found in the form of bacteria, worms and crustaceans, which teem in the abyssal plains that cover vast stretches of the deep. They feed off <a href="http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/marinesnow.html">organic "snow"</a> that falls from above. Deep below the sea floor, life was not thought to be possible. But then in 2003 researchers found many unique bacteria in sediments 300 m beneath the Pacific seafloor, feeding on sediments millions of years old.

More spectacular are the <a href="http://ocean.si.edu/deep-sea-corals">deep-sea corals</a>, found at depths of up to 6000 m in waters as cold as 2°C. Despite this, they rival their tropical, shallow-water cousins in splendour. These slow-growing animals are now found from Ireland to New Zealand, and have even been discovered growing on the legs of oil rigs. But, it is only as destructive fishing practices, such as trawling, have started to destroy them that the realisation of how widespread they are has dawned. The <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9967-introduction-mysteries-of-the-deep-sea.html#.Uqc6J2RDt94">largest known</a>, near Norway, covers 100 square kilometres, yet was discovered only in 2002.</p>
