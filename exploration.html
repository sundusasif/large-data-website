          <h2>Weird world</h2>
<p>
The bizarre inhabitants of the deep include: deep water sharks; devilish-looking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfish">dragonfish</a>, that fire beams of red illumination from "lamps" under their eyes; many bioluminescent fish; ancient coelacanths; creeping sea lilies; blood-red squid; an octopus with glow-in-the-dark suckers; bell-shaped, metre-wide jellyfish, snails with armour-plated feet and a deadly jellyfish relative that uses fluorescent tentacles to lure prey.

Perhaps the most dramatic creature is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_squid">13-metre-long giant squid</a>, Architeuthis and the even more fearsome 15-metre-long colossal squid, never seen alive. <a href="http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/sperm-whale/">Sperm whales</a> and <a href="http://marinebio.org/species.asp?id=382">Antarctic sleeper sharks</a> are the only animals equipped to take on these deep-sea prey.

Life is also found in the form of bacteria, worms and crustaceans, which teem in the abyssal plains that cover vast stretches of the deep. They feed off <a href="http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/marinesnow.html">organic "snow"</a> that falls from above. Deep below the sea floor, life was not thought to be possible. But then in 2003 researchers found many unique bacteria in sediments 300 m beneath the Pacific seafloor, feeding on sediments millions of years old.

More spectacular are the <a href="http://ocean.si.edu/deep-sea-corals">deep-sea corals</a>, found at depths of up to 6000 m in waters as cold as 2°C. Despite this, they rival their tropical, shallow-water cousins in splendour. These slow-growing animals are now found from Ireland to New Zealand, and have even been discovered growing on the legs of oil rigs. But, it is only as destructive fishing practices, such as trawling, have started to destroy them that the realisation of how widespread they are has dawned. The <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9967-introduction-mysteries-of-the-deep-sea.html#.Uqc6J2RDt94">largest known</a>, near Norway, covers 100 square kilometres, yet was discovered only in 2002.</p>

          <h2>Hydrothermal marvels</h2>
          <p>In some places, life is found in an extraordinary abundance. One of the most fascinating deep-sea ecosystems are found around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent">hydrothermal vents</a>, where superheated water, rich in chemicals, spews from volcanically active mid-ocean ridges. Here, bacteria feeding on methane and sulphides support large communities of animals including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_clam">giant clams</a>, bizarre fish, and massive tube worms up 2 m in length, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_tube_worm">Riftia pachyptila</a>.

Photosynthetic bacteria which harvest the vents' faint glow have even been discovered, while others can thrive in water hotter than 121°C. These vents are often isolated, and spinning plumes of water may break off like flying saucers, carrying bacteria to other vents.

These <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent">vents</a>, known as "black smokers", were first discovered in 1977. The discovery of an entire ecosystem 2000 m down, that did not depend on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>, revolutionised our view of life. We now know these ecosystems are commonly found from Scandinavia to the Pacific Ocean. They occur along the mid-ocean ridge system, from relatively shallow water to as deep as several kilometres.

Some even believe that life on Earth may have begun at these vents, which can be up to 60 m in height. Others think similar geological features could harbour life in frozen lakes on Earth and on other planets and moons, such as Mars or Europa.

Hydrothermal vents are not the only oases of life on the deep sea floor. In 1984, biologists discovered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_seep">cold seeps</a>. These are places where chemical-rich water oozes from the seafloor, supporting an abundance of life. They are usually found around the edges of continents.

Deep sea exploration began in the 1930s, when US oceanographers descended 1000 m down in a tethered steel ball. In the 1960s the Swiss Bathyscaphe descended 11 kilometres down into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_Trench">Marianas trench</a> off the Phillipines - the deepest place on the planet. Since then, no person has ventured so deep.</p>
